# Rocket Mapper
The following is my first attempt at making an iOS Application after going through: "iOS 11 & Swift 4 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.


## What does it do?
Rocket Mapper is meant to display the rocket launches nearest to the user at the time of coming on screen. To do this there are currently two planned features:

1. A list of the 5 nearest launches to the user

2. A Google Maps interface which shows all of the launches within the next 2 weeks.


## Current TODO:
1. Add Constraints to the Home View
2. Start using CoreLocation to display the user's location in Lat/Lon
3. Change the maps instance to center on the phone's coordinates
4. Start reading from the API
5. Start Populating the view from the API
